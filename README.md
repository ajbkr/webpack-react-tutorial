React, webpack, and Babel
=========================

Slightly reworked example from Valentino Gagliardi's [Tutorial: How to set up
React, webpack, and Babel 7 from scratch
(2019)](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/react-webpack-babel/).

I have added linting using [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/).

To run the linter:

```
$ npm run lint
```

And to execute the server itself:

```
$ npm start
```
